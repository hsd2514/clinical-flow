# Agent workflow (always)

- Follow `agent.md` in the repo root.
- Prefer working in the **repo root**. Don’t create new top-level project folders unless the user explicitly asks.
- Make **minimal, focused diffs**; match existing patterns.
- Don’t add secrets; use placeholders + document required env vars.
- Don’t create git commits unless explicitly requested.
- When you change behavior, include a **test plan** (tests run or manual steps).
